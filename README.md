Steps to run the application:

- Open the index.html file in your browser, it can be latest versions of Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer
- Move the player using the arrows on your keyboard: LEFT, TOP, RIGHT and BOTTOM.
- Each arrow will move the player one block at the time.
- The objective is making the player reach the water, by passing through the stone and avoiding the enemies (insects)
- Each time you get to the water, you get 10 points!
- Try to pick up the stars to gain bonus points.
- If an insect reaches the player, you will loose the game!
- But don't worry, you can restart the game by pressing the UP arrow again. Enjoy!
